                <P>I am a full-stack Software Engineering graduate at General Assembly, with experience in front-end and back-end coding, including JavaScript (Node, jQuery, Bootstrap), Python, HTML, CSS / SCSS, Git, and Bash.</P>

                <H5>My Background</H5>
                <P>Prior to Software Development, I built a career in Investment Banking and Private Equity for 12 years, where I developed a broad skill base across fund-raising for multi-billion-dollar companies, project management to tight deadlines, originating new deals, and negotiating on behalf of clients. I also gained core technical skills, such as marketing a companyâ€™s core value proposition, deriving and defending corporate valuations, as well as finance, accounting, and corporate tax knowledge.</P>
                <H5 >What Drives Me</H5>
                <P>With 19 completed fund-raising, mergers, and acquisitions deals, with an aggregate deal value of $16bn, I have a strong track record in tech-enabled Business Services. I am passionate about technology-enhanced and subscription-based business models and I am looking to work with start-ups, developing a more robust business model that is both customer and investor centric.</P>
